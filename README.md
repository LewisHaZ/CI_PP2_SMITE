## Introduction
Hello and welcome to the Read Me documentation for my PP2 project, named: Memory Card and Quiz games based on the video game SMITE (one of my favourite of all time).
This project includes two seperate games for the user to enjoy, spanning over two webpgaes. The theme of the project is solely based around the aforementioned video game
of SMITE, a project made by a company called Hi-Rez Studios who are based in Alpharetta, Georgia in the USA. Many of the games features, typography and imagery have been
crafted with the elements seen from SMITE in mind.
