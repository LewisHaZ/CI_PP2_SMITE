## Introduction
Hello and welcome to the Read Me documentation for my PP2 project, named: Memory Card and Quiz games based on the video game SMITE (one of my favourite of all time).
This project includes two seperate games for the user to enjoy, spanning over two webpgaes. The theme of the project is solely based around the aforementioned video game
of SMITE, a project made by a company called Hi-Rez Studios who are based in Alpharetta, Georgia in the USA. Many of the games features, typography and imagery have been
crafted with the elements seen from SMITE in mind. 

## User manual
The website has been created to work on any device: mobiles, tablets, desktops & macbooks. Each device will have its own different viewing experiences in order to make sure the content can be viewed and accessed to its full capacity. There is no complicated controls for each of the games and the user is only required to be able to click on certain section of the screen at the point of the game loading in.

## Design

### Design Choice
- The design choice for the website is based on the game 'SMITE', with the colour and visual elements for the site being similar to that of what can be seen the actual video game itself.

### Colour Scheme
- To expand on the colour of the website, it has been kept consistent across all pages and is mainly inspired by the logo of the game itself. This being a black and yellow palette, black being used for the background elements whilst yellow is used for all the page elements such as boxes and text.
- The idea behind the colour palette was to have the user be able to see all the relevant information on the screen easily whilst also potentially seeing that it matches the game's logo colour palette too.

### Fonts
Google Fonts has been implemented on the website, Tilt Prism has been used for the main elements of the site with San Serif being used as the fallback font. The font Tilt Prism has been used to match my game's theme which is Mythology and Gods/Goddesses. Other fonts have been used such as Times New Roman to bring extra attention to the sections where it has been used, this font's name is also the name of a Pantheon so I found it fitting.

### Structure
- A game screen for each game, which can be accessed through the navbar. 
- A page for feedback, which includes a inputs for their name/email/message for the developer. It can also be accessed with the navbar.
- A modal for when the user completes the matching card game, this shows them their stats and results for the game and also an option to start the game again.
- A screen popup for when the user gets a question correct or incorrect, immediate feedback for them to know the result and to start the next question after 5 seconds.
- An end of game result for the quiz with an option with a button to restart the quiz and try again.
- A 404 page which can only be accessed by incorrectly typing a non-existent website link into the address bar.
